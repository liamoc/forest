\taxon{Remark}
\p{The choices of semantic domain and valuation function are, essentially, arbitrary: we choose objects that reflect those aspects of our programs that we are interested in. For most of the simple languages we will examine, we are only concerned with the \em{results} of the computation, which is a semantics suitable for reasoning about program behaviour and correctness. However, there also exist denotational \em{cost models} that compositionally assign a measure of program performance to syntax. This measure is just another kind of [denotational semantics](dt-0001).}
