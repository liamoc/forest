	The [category](dm-000G) #{\mathbf{Rel}} is the [category](dm-000G) where the objects are (small) \em{sets}, the morphisms are \em{relations} between these sets, composition is relational composition: ##{g \circ f \triangleq \{ (a,b) \mid \exists i.\ (a,i) \in f \land (i,b) \in g \}} and identity is the diagonal relation (equality).
