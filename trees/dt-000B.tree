\title{information ordering}
\taxon{definition}
\p{An information ordering is a [[dm-0000]] on denotations, written #{a \sqsubseteq b}. This indicates that #{b} is \em{approximated by}, or carries \em{more information} than, or is \em{more well-defined} than #{a}.
Naturally, [[dt-000A]], being totally uninformative, is always the least element in this ordering.}
