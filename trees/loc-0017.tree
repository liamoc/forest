\title{DECRA, Grants, etc.}
\p{Now that DECRA (an early-career research grant in Australia) assessments are back, I am busy working on my rejoinder. It really is a soul-crushing part of the job, but a lot of the feedback I got (from the unusually numerous 6 assessors!) was very positive. This will be the last time I can apply for the DECRA, as I will not be eligible in future and the DECRA [may not exist](https://www.arc.gov.au/engage-us/consultations/policy-review-national-competitive-grants-program/faqs).}
