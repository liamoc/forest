\title{Safe vs Unsafe Rules}
\p{Rules such as \code{conjI}, \code{impI}, or \code{disjE} that cannot change a \em{provable} goal into \em{unprovable} goal(s) are called \em{safe}. Isabelle's automation strategies like safe rules because they can apply them without fear, or the need for backtracking. You can mark a rule as safe by marking it \code{[intro!]} or \code{[elim!]}. This can also be done locally when invoking methods like [[isa-002P]].}
