\p{Given a theorem \code{r}#{: A = B} (typically a defining equation given by  [the \code{definition} command](isa-001G)), \code{apply (unfold r)} replaces every occurrence of #{A} in the current goal with #{B}.}
\p{If the theorem \code{r} has premises, then all of those premises must be directly satisfied by assumptions in the current goal for \code{unfold} to succeed.}
