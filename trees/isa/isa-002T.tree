\title{\code{try} and the famous Isabelle sledgehammer.}
\p{Isabelle includes a feature called the \em{sledgehammer} that invokes external proof search procedures (such as SMT solvers) and provides them with lemmas that appear to be relevant. If the tools find a proof, it can often replay them in Isabelle's proof kernel, giving an Isabelle proof that matches what the external proof tool found. }
\p{To invoke this procedure on a goal, searching automatically for related lemmas, type the word \code{try} in an open subgoal.}
