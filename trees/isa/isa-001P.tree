\title{\code{induct} (for structural induction)}
\p{While it is possible to use \code{rule} or \code{erule} with the generated \code{.induct} theorem from a [\code{datatype}](isa-001K), it is usually much simpler and more convenient to use the \code{induct} proof method. Similar to the [[isa-001L]] method, \code{apply (induct t)} splits the goal into various cases, one for each constructor of the type of \code{t}. The difference is that for recursive cases of the datatype, we also get an \em{inductive hypothesis} added to our assumptions.}
