\title{\code{clarsimp}, \code{slowsimp}, \code{bestsimp} and \code{fastforce}}
\p{\code{clarsimp} the combination of [clarify](isa-002Q) and [simp](isa-001H), and is very useful when doing exploratory proving. \code{slowsimp} is the combination of [slow](isa-002P) and [simp](isa-001H). \code{bestsimp} is the combination of [best](isa-002P) and [simp](isa-001H). The combination of  [fast](isa-002P) and [simp](isa-001H) is, for inexplicable reasons, called \code{fastforce}.}
