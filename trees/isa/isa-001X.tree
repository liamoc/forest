\p{Methods can be combined using the \code{;} operator:}
\shiki{apply (m1; m2)}
\p{This applies \code{m2} to \em{every subgoal} that results from applying \code{m1} to the current goal. It can be chained together multiple times. For example, the entire proof of \ref{isa-001W} can be much more succinctly expressed as one line:}
\shiki{by (case_tac s; case_tac r; simp)}
