\title{Generalising the induction hypothesis with \code{arbitrary}}
\p{By default, [structural induction](isa-001P) \code{induct t} produces an induction hypothesis for the variables directly mentioned in \code{t}, and [rule induction](isa-0029) \code{induct rule: p.induct} produces a hypothesis for the variables directly mentioned by the eliminated \code{p} assumption.}
\p{Sometimes you need a stronger hypothesis that generalises across additional variables in the goal. The \code{arbitrary} option tells the \code{induct} method to generalise certain variables, so the induction hypothesis assumes the property holds for all values of those variables.}
