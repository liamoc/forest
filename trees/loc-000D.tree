\title{Ngunnawal and Ngambri country}
\author{liamoc}
\p{The Ngunnawal (/ŋʌnəwəl/) and Ngambri (/ŋæmbɾi/) peoples are the original inhabitants and custodians of the land on which Canberra, the capital city of Australia, is built. They lived here for over 20,000 years before white settler colonisation.}
\p{The National Museum of Australia shares some of their [community stories](https://www.nma.gov.au/learn/encounters-education/community-stories/canberra).}
\p{The indigenous inhabitants of Australia had their land taken from them. The least we can do is pay our respects to them and their elders, past and present. }
