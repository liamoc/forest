\title{"AI is Destroying Learning Itself"}
\p{I've already listed a [decent number of anti-LLM articles](loc-001H) from various perspectives: the technological assault on artistic pursuit, authentic self-development, our social protocols, and on the stability of the economy, but (beyond the [open letter itself](loc-001H)) I hadn't seen much quality writing on the profound damage this technology is doing to higher education, until I read [this current affairs article](https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/ai-is-destroying-the-university-and-learning-itself) by Ronald Purser. A lot of it ties in with a [general decline in conscientiousness](loc-001M) that I think is not only a sign of a sick society, but also a deeply unfulfilling one. It's well worth the read.  }
