\p{I am generally available via email, at \code{me@} this domain. I may also be found on Discord (\code{liamoc}), various Zulips (SPLS, Lean, Agda), the [cogent-club slack](https://cogent-club.slack.com/), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/liamoc.net), [the types.pl mastodon instance](https://types.pl/@liamoc), and inexplicably still [twitter](https://twitter.com/kamatsu8). My office is Room N213 in the Skaidrite Darius Building (CSIT) 108 on the [ANU](anu) Campus. The office door is open to the public so feel free to pop over if you want to visit me. To ensure my availability, it may be wise to first contact me via other means to make an appointment.}
\p{If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my [ANU](anu) email (\code{liam.oconnor} at \code{anu.edu.au}), or on the appropriate course forum (e.g. Ed).}
\p{If you are in possession of my telephone number, please avoid calling unless absolutely necessary.}
