\p{I specialise in the intersection of programming languages and formal methods, with a particular emphasis on type systems, test frameworks and other connections between speciÔ¨Åcation and implementation.}
\p{I enjoy applying theory to practice: developing programming languages and tools based on established theoretical models and techniques.}
\p{I also enjoy applying \em{practice} to \em{theory}, that is, developing new theoretical understanding motivated by practical needs.}
