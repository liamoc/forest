\tag{talk}
\p{Most materials aimed at teaching people how to write, even within an academic context, focus largely on giving a rules-based framework for structure and prose style. These frameworks are based on outdated and inaccurate models of knowledge and are not suitable for academic writing. In this talk I will try to challenge some of the assumptions you have about writing papers, what (and who) writing papers is for, and how to think about writing as part of a research process.}
