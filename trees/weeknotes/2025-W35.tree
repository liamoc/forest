\p{This week included my aforementioned [move to Dickson](loc-001O). I'm really liking my new place, even though I haven't unpacked everything yet. Having a reasonably authentic bánh mì shop nearby is a huge relief after trying the mostly poor-quality bánh mì sold at most other Canberra locations (let alone the pathetic excuses for bánh mì sold in Edinburgh). Also the walking routes to both church and the university are, while a bit longer than what I'm used to, very full of natural beauty and mostly quiet and free of traffic noise. }
\p{Work-wise, this week was mostly [[icfpc25]] preparation, as well as preparing for my upcoming trip to Portugal. }
