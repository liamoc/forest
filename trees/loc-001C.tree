\title{Reviewing done}
\p{
  With the cancellation of [FProPer](fproper25) this year due to low submissions, I believe I have finally finished my reviewing marathon for this year. I served on the [PLDI](pldi25) (11 papers), [ICFP](icfp25) (7 papers), [APLAS](aplas25) (4 papers) and [Haskell Symposium](haskell25) (4 papers) PCs this year, plus reviewed one paper for the [Journal of Functional Programming](jfp), giving me a total of 27 papers reviewed this year. Now that that's over with, I will focus my attention on preparing the [ICFP Programming Contest](icfpc25) and preparing to teach first-year computing next semester.
