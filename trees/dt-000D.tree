\title{combining domains}
\p{Some of our semantics may depend on the combination of multiple domains, i.e. semantic functions of multiple arguments. As an example, the semantics of an
\syn{if} statement combines the semantics of the condition and the semantics of each of the two branches. In such scenarios, our domains are no longer flat â€” we must generalise to [[dt-000G]]s.}
