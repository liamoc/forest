\title{Open Letter against LLMs in Education}
\p{Those close to me know that I believe generative AI technologies, particularly when used to replace human creative pursuits, are fundamentally a spiritually damaging invention. It is fundamentally wrong and harmful to humanity. We would all be better off if we consigned this technology to the dustbin of history.}

\p{I believe this on a deeper level than most of my intellectual concerns. In short, I oppose this technology for religious reasons. I say "religious reasons" because religious convictions are personal and aren't typically up for debate in public conversation. I have no interest in debating the merits of this technology. Also, my actual religious views, such as they are, place a great deal of emphasis on the dignity of the human person and the value of human connections. This technology undermines and devalues both.}

\p{Rather than try to expound upon this topic, which makes me depressed and miserable, I will just link some articles by various talented people that I think well encapsulate my views:}

\p{For this reason I was very pleased when I saw that [[edwinb]] and [[jonsterling]] had signed and shared [this open letter](https://openletter.earth/an-open-letter-from-educators-who-refuse-the-call-to-adopt-genai-in-education-cb4aee75) for educators to outright reject the use of generative AI in their classrooms. I was proud to sign. I encourage all of you reading, if you work in education, to sign as well.}
