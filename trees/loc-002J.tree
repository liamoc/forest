\title{SAPLING Report}
\p{Today I went with many colleagues to [[google-syd]] for the [Sydney Area Programming Languages Interest Group (SAPLING) 2025 meeting](https://comp.anu.edu.au/sapling/index.html). I didn't present anything at the meeting but my PhD student, [[xinloi]] did a lightning talk introducing her work on incorrectness logic.}
\p{It was good to see many colleagues from [[unsw]] and catch up with some of my former students who were now working for Google.}
