\p{In addition to my computer science career I am also a classically-trained singer, with extensive experience in liturgical music in the Catholic and Anglican traditions.}

\p{Currently, I sing with the Choir of [All Saints Ainslie](https://allsaintsainslie.org.au), located near my home in Canberra. We sing for most of the weekly Sunday Eucharist services as well as semi-regular Evensong services. I am also available for liturgical singing in and around the Canberra area. Please [get in touch](loc-0009) if you are interested.}

\p{I began my musical career as a treble in [St. Mary's Cathedral Choir](https://cathedralchoir.sydney/), Sydney at the age of 10. At that time, St. Mary's was under the direction of David Russell, who encouraged me to pursue my interest in medieval liturgical music. I studied Gregorian Chant semiology and performance, both independently and under the tutelage of Prof. Neil McEwan FRSCM.}

\p{From 2006-2010 I led the Schola Cantorum at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, performing the propers of the mass every Sunday. I also performed occasionally with many other choirs, including: the Choir of [Christ Church St. Laurence](https://ccsl.org.au/) in Sydney, the [Australian Brandenburg Choir](https://www.brandenburg.com.au/), and others. After Pope Benedict XVI's \em{Summorum pontificum}, I ran a Schola Cantorum to assist in the performance of chant propers and ordinaries in Latin masses around Sydney and later in Edinburgh, after I moved there.}

\p{In 2022 I visited the monks at the [Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes](https://www.solesmes.com/), under Dom Geoffrey Kemlin. In Edinburgh I sang with the the Choir of [St. Michael and All Saints](https://smas.church/) Episcopal Church. I am a member of the [Royal School of Church Music](https://rscmaustralia.org.au/).}

\p{In particular, I have an interest and considerable expertise in the rich chant tradition of the medieval western church, and I am seeking rare prayer books, hymnals, graduals, nocturnals, vesperals, diurnals, antiphonaries and similar.}
